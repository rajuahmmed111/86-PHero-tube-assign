            <h3>1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>
            <div>
                <p>VAR : The scope of a variable declared with var is one of the following
                    curly-brace-enclosed syntaxes that most closely contains the var
                    statement: Function body. Static initialization block
                <br> <br>
                  LET : Compared with var , let declarations have the following differences: let
                  declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions. let declarations can only 
                  be accessed after the place of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone). For this 
                  reason, let declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.
                <br> <br>
                  CONST : const declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions. const declarations
                   can only be accessed after the line of declaration is reached (see temporal dead zone).
                    For this reason, const declarations are commonly regarded as non-hoisted.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>
            <div>
                <p>NULL : Null in many programming languages is used to denote an empty pointer or
                     an unknown value. You can define the null value as 0 in these languages.
                <br> <br>
                  UNDEFINED : The undefined global property represents the primitive value undefined.
                   It is one of JavaScript's primitive types
                
            </div>
            <h3>3. What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how
                     applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API
                      is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational 
                      state transfer architectural style.</p>
